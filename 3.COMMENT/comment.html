           <h2>GOOD WILL HUNTING</h2>
           <p>
           20-year-old South Boston janitor Will Hunting, an unrecognized genius who,
           as part of a deferred prosecution agreement after assaulting a police officer,
           becomes a patient of a therapist and studies advanced mathematics with a renowned professor. 
           Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend, his girlfriend, 
           and himself, facing the significant task of confronting his past and thinking about his future.

                   Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, 
                   by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series, after falling in love at first sight. 
                   Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to "see about a girl," and he does not regret his decision. 
                   This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant 
                   to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective 
                   look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.

                   Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his "chief negotiator", 
                   and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. 
                   Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically 
                   abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. 
                   Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately 
                   sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions 
                   he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means 
                   leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep thinking Will has 
                   moved on to something greater.

                Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims
                 of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to
                  break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles 
                  with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a Chevrolet Nova for his 21st birthday so he can commute 
                  to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will sends Sean 
                  a letter telling him to tell Lambeau that he had to go "see about a girl", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading 
                  to California to reunite with Skylar.
